I am currently a final-year undergraduate student in [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/). My Major is Computer Science (sub-major as Data Science and Big Data Tech). I have tried diverse research topics in the past undergrad college life and I am so honored to have the chance to work with these outstanding scholars, including working on Macaqueâ€™s Decision Behavioral Data (Computational Neuroscience), supervised by Dr. [Aaron Sampson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jy8NxFYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Ernst Niebur](https://krieger.jhu.edu/mbi/directory/ernst-niebur/) in [Zanvyl Krieger Mind/Brain Institute](https://krieger.jhu.edu/mbi/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/).
